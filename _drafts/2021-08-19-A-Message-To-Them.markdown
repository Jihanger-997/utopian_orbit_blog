Come my 'dear' ones

Try again

This time I'm not below the law

My faith is and always will be greater than your dirty games.

My soul will not be substituted

My soul will not be sold

My soul will prevail.

Try to harm any of my dear ones

They will be shown the truth as well

I have means for that.
