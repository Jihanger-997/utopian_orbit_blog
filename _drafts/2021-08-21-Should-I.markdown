It's calling me once again

Should I partake in it

Or will it just make me insane?

Feels like once again I am given a choice

To regress one hundred steps

And then advance one thousand.

Will it just make me insane?

These voices I hear before I sleep

Started to emerge once I awaken

One of the guides tells me they won't appear by daylight

How can he be so sure?

I'll just go empty my mind

Not like I remember what they say anyway.
