We were two degenerates

and after a long time without contact

I noticed

Just like you did ages before.

I'm grateful to you cutting me off

I wouldn't have enjoyed you seeing more of my momentary insanity that only with drugs is brought to peace.

What in my delusions were moments of love and moments of pure hatred

Has turned into a distant memory just like a flashback.

I drank the Elixir of love

As I believed for a while

Or was it a trap like all who are around me believe?

I'd rather believe in the former, it brings me a brief peace

However, saddened I am with the needle I take every month, that seems to be in conflict with stated Elixir.
