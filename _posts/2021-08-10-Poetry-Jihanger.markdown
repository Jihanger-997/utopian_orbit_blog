Below you will find poetry written by me, as myself.


The Two of Us
-------------
We were two degenerates

and after a long time without contact

I noticed

Just like you did ages before.

I'm grateful to you cutting me off

I wouldn't have enjoyed you seeing more of my momentary insanity that only with drugs is brought to peace.

What in my delusions were moments of love and moments of pure hatred

Has turned into a distant memory just like a flashback.

I drank the Elixir of love

As I believed for a while

Or was it a trap like all who are around me believe?

I'd rather believe in the former, it brings me a brief peace

However, saddened I am by the needle I take every month, that seems to be in conflict with stated Elixir.

Realizations
-------------
They tried to kill me

But I did not know I had such strength.

Maybe even they were blinded

The ego is/was so big that it disabled them from seeing within this reality.

I write with hatred

But this is not what my soul wants

I will definetely notice a way of accepting such realization.

He never fails.

Apologies
-------------
I'm sorry

But know that I don't regret everything

It was all necessary so that today we can be friends.

Living in different worlds

But I know there are similarities beyond what my mind blocks.

I forget that the two of us though really suspicious of people

We are always friendly at first sight.

Intrusive Thoughts
-------------
Why are these thoughts still here?

It's been so long since you happened

I'm not even the same anymore

Completely transformed

And you are to praise

That vacation.

A New Life
-------------
One

Two

Three were there

The beggining of ruin

The beggining of growth

The future restart.

Tripping.

Right after that you came

We've known each other for ages

But right after rediscovering ourselves

We lost each other.

What will it be now

Now that we know that what we know

Is everything we need to know at the given time.

Reset.

Not even if I tried explaining

You would understand

Not even if you know you understand

I know,

And do not understand.

Visitation
-------------
Today I dreamed with you.

Son, wake up.

Paralyzed

And then I travel with you

In an esoteric and also a literal sense.

Thanks for the visit

With that I know I'm on the right path.

Should I
-------------
It's calling me once again

Should I partake in it

Or will it just make me insane?

Feels like once again I am given a choice

To regress one hundred steps

And then advance one thousand.

Will it just make me insane?

These voices I hear before I sleep

Started to emerge once I awaken

One of the guides tells me they won't appear by daylight

How can he be so sure?

I'll just go empty my mind

Not like I remember what they say anyway.
