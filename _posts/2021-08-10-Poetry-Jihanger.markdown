Child of Eden OST - Evolution (some remix I can't find the name of)

Below you will find poetry written by me, as myself (my alter ego has another section). The newest poetry is always at the bottom, it's supposed to show the evolution of my thoughts throughout the years since I started writing.


<h1>2019</h1>

The Two of Us
-------------
We were two degenerates

and after a long time without contact

I noticed

Just like you did ages before.

I'm grateful to you cutting me off

I wouldn't have enjoyed you seeing more of my momentary insanity that only with drugs is brought to peace.

What in my delusions were moments of love and moments of pure hatred

Has turned into a distant memory just like a flashback.

I drank the Elixir of love

As I believed for a while

Or was it a trap like all who are around me believe?

I'd rather believe in the former, it brings me a brief peace

However, saddened I am by the needle I take every month, that seems to be in conflict with stated Elixir.

Realizations
-------------
They tried to kill me

But I did not know I had such strength.

Maybe even they were blinded

The ego is/was so big that it disabled them from seeing within this reality.

I write with hatred

But this is not what my soul wants

I will definetely notice a way of accepting such realization.

He never fails.

The Cameras
------------
I want you to follow me

But I'm not a prophet

I've just seen things.

I'm not perfect

No one is.

I know this is just the cameras and the demons.

Apologies
-------------
I'm sorry

But know that I don't regret everything

It was all necessary so that today we can be friends.

Living in different worlds

But I know there are similarities beyond what my mind blocks.

I forget that the two of us though really suspicious of people

We are always friendly at first sight.

Intrusive Thoughts
-------------
Why are these thoughts still here?

It's been so long since you happened

I'm not even the same anymore

Completely transformed

And you are to praise

That vacation.

Survivor
-------------
I see sounds

Nothing abnormal here,

Just a child that partially survived.

Re-reading the voices inside my own mind.

A New Life
-------------
One

Two

Three were there

The beggining of ruin

The beggining of growth

The future restart.

Tripping.

Right after that you came

We've known each other for ages

But right after rediscovering ourselves

We lost each other.

What will it be now

Now that we know that what we know

Is everything we need to know at the given time.

Reset.

Not even if I tried explaining

You would understand

Not even if you know you understand

I know,

And do not understand.

The Moon and the blue-eyed boy
-------------
Artemis, Diana, Jaci

The Three Goddesses.

With its original imperfections

An incomparable uniqueness.

The most beautiful.

Innocent when new

Seductive in her crescent

Intense when full

And in its waning a mystery.

Regardless of your opening

A portal to Love.

My walls break with your presence

Brick by brick

A glow so intense that my barriers are lost in the mad tangle of my insanity.

Insanity.

An unprecedented acceptance that all my schizophrenia has subsided.

I crazy

She sane

However not balanced.

The moon is not following its cycle

But soon it will be for its entire existence.

.

.

.

blue eyed boy

shine without you even noticing

face my innocence

take me out of comfort

but look at the bottom

where there is soul to be found.

tranquility that my

hard smile that never comes

neutral soul with an inner war

I see

what causes the confrontation

is your facility

and gift

to be deep

to be sorry

to love a lot

to take care a lot.

I see

what you try to hide

if mine or yours is crazy

I can't tell

but I just say that

we are crazy

because in a way

understand each other

we joined little by little

along with all affinities.

You're not crazy

crazy is me,

I even see paradises in beautiful skies

like yours

I even envy what carries so

close to you,

these eyes are pure envy of mine

and i would say

how crazy would it be

to leave my mania

of wanting to smile back

for your giggle.

can be everything you want to be

put faith in everything I do

and take care closely of those who

not even ever cared.

big heart boy,

madness is ours

to think you are too crazy

for having eyes like hallelujah

but stopping talking about such

I'm crazy about always wanting more.

Visitation
-------------
Today I dreamed with you.

Son, wake up.

Paralyzed

And then I travel with you

In an esoteric and also a literal sense.

Thanks for the visit

With that I know I'm on the right path.

Should I
-------------
It's calling me once again

Should I partake in it

Or will it just make me insane?

Feels like once again I am given a choice

To regress one hundred steps

And then advance one thousand.

Will it just make me insane?

These voices I hear before I sleep

Started to emerge once I awaken

One of the guides tells me they won't appear by daylight

How can he be so sure?

I'll just go empty my mind

Not like I remember what they say anyway.

The Saddest Day
-------------
And that was the day I realized

That your day was coming.

How could I accept that you,

My dearest,

Would not see my children

Would not have dinner with my first salary

Would not see my dreams come true

.
.
.

I couldn't hold my tears

I ran into your arms.

You didn't hold yours either.

Bad Habits
------------
You came as a friend

One that would bring me joy.

The first times we were together

It was pure bliss.

I felt completed.

But you disgraced my temple.

.

Now I see you everyday all day

I can't follow my dreams with you blocking the road.

.

I will leave you

I know I will

But you are so tempting

So seductive.

You give me what I want

But not what I need

And I give you everything

My brain

My heart

My lungs

My life.

Wish you could just leave

But it's not as easy as I thought the first time we kissed.

You polluted me.

Body and soul.

To my worst addiction - 11/11/2020

<hr>

Regrets
------------
All I wanted was to see you smile.

Though you wanted to

You couldn't,

My smile also wasn't real

Intoxicated.

Always.

How could I smile

When my mind still believed I was corrupt.

The pureness of a child's soul taken away by his lust.

And this reflected on all of you

I just wish you didn't have those same feelings

From when I was asleep.

They will corrupt you.

They will reflect on others.

Conquer

Assimilate

Release.

Either that

Or suffer with the corruption

Until you are able to see light again.

<h1>2021</h1>

Parallel Life
-------------
Feels like the game I was in is still going,

Only now I'm in spectator mode.

Waiting for the controller,

And be player one

Once again.

The Seed
-------------
I've seen you grow,

But there's still a long way to go.

Both you and I have been through similar

But nothing will ever destroy our light.

The seed that was planted in us,

Is not what they say and think it is.

Let it grow.

Art
-------------
How can one person feel another

Even before this one was born.

Long live the art

The art of living in the now

And the art of understanding that there is life beyond life

And manage to hide the message

So you can rest in peace.

Hope
-------------
I always believed I'd reset my brain

And it became a reality.

It seems like it's true that

Hope is the key.

Hope in the future

Of ourselves

Of our families

Of our community

Of our world

Of our universe.

Keep the flame lit

Wonderful things can and will happen.

Lies to Escape
-------------
Liar I was

But never treacherous

I just wanted to avoid fights

Avoid problems

Escape, always on the run.

A distorted image of who I was

The real authenticity smoked by unreal words and promises.

I never wanted to hurt anyone

But I hurt so many.

Personality
------------
Don't be afraid of the judgment of being who you really want to be

Everything will fall into place.

And when you have reasons to be grateful

Be with all your available love.

A Little Bit of Compassion
------------
Addiction is not something we chose

You can't ask someone if they really want to stop

It's not that it was out of our hands

It just used to control us

It's not that we were weak

It's not that we were astray.

.

.

.

I wrote this as I smoked

And yet, with all this eminent clarity I have about it

I have to be stronger than it

I have to move forward

And be thankful for it.

A Little Bit Too Much of Oxygen
-------------
I took the chance

Involutarily.

Without the regressions of steps

I launched myself forward

On my own pace.

I've learned so much this time

Oxygen is the key

Breathe.

The Light That Shines On Me
-------------
There's always a first time

My emotions can't even be transmuted into words

But these feelings and thoughts

Of being present

Of thinking in what is to come

To enable on making it happen

I've never exposed myself so much

With little fear

Without the regrets of the past controlling my mind

With so much passion

When we talk

It's like all the problems around me

Just travel to another plane

And come back with so much compassion

That even my true self is able to shine on those around me

A self that is absurdly happy

With dumb smiles and cheerful songs

>

A Quick Reminder For Myself
-------------
I am stronger than what I think I am

I keep forgetting that

Even with all the orders and delusions

I didn't hurt anyone

I didn't hurt myself

I didn't do what I was being told to do.

With all the misunderstandings that I caused

When being faced with darkness

I was stronger than it.

I also have to keep in mind

That what I saw

Most don't come back from it

I have a strong will

And it will stay that way.
