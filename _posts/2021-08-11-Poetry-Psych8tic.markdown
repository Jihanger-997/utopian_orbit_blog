Psych8tic is my alter-ego. Poems written when I am in his state are a bit more dark, maybe more direct and definetely more aggresive. The people who met me know that I am a very calm person, and these poems might sound a little bit off of who I am. Regardless, they are part of me, or were, this alter-ego is slowly fading with time, and I guess it's for the best.

Beware of the shadow people, enjoy my poetry!



Alter Ego's Mind
-------------
I cast you into my realm.

A realm of joy

A realm of calmness

A realm of love

A realm of madness.

Intensity?

You'll occasionally find it

Be it through obstacles

Or be it through clashes.

The impossible plane of rest and insanity

The simple mind can't understand it

The complex one is amazed.

Ego?

Believe me

You can't live without it

So I'll conjure my words with it imbued

At least at this moment of truth.

You'll see visions

You'll hear voices before you sleep

You'll experience the next's reality

Even if by a brief moment,

You'll experience All.

But don't be scared

Everything is manageable.

You chose this path afterall.

Don't lose yourself to omniscience

Your physical manifestation can't handle it

Because in the end

We know nothing

You will see.

The Afterbright
-------------
The first rule was to not talk about it

And I broke it.

A worse simulation was set for me

Full of familiar figures that became my enemies.

Witches and lizards

These were the only things I could see

Transforming in front of me into their true essence

Right in front of my eyes.

Still, there are those that crossed my path for an insignificant amount of time

But still nailed their space in my memory.

..

...

More need to wake up, I'm tired of waiting.

A Message to Them
-------------
Come my 'dear' ones

Try again

This time I'm not below the law

My faith is and always will be greater than your dirty games.

My soul will not be substituted

My soul will not be sold

My soul will prevail.

Try to harm any of my dear ones

They will be shown the truth as well

I have means for that.
