Psych8tic is my alter-ego. Poems written when I am in his state are a bit more dark, maybe more direct and definetely more aggresive and delusional. The people who met me know that I am a very calm person, and these poems might sound a little bit off of who I am. Regardless, they are part of me, or were, this alter-ego is slowly fading with time, and I guess it's for the best.

Beware the shadow people!

Alter Ego's Mind
-------------
I cast you into my realm.

A realm of joy

A realm of calmness

A realm of love

A realm of madness.

Intensity?

You'll occasionally find it

Be it through obstacles

Or be it through clashes.

The impossible plane of rest and insanity

The simple mind can't understand it

The complex one is amazed.

Ego?

Believe me

You can't live without it

So I'll conjure my words with it imbued

At least at this moment of truth.

You'll see visions

You'll hear voices before you sleep

You'll experience the next's reality

Even if by a brief moment,

You'll experience All.

But don't be scared

Everything is manageable.

You chose this path afterall.

Don't lose yourself to omniscience

Your physical manifestation can't handle it

Because in the end

We know nothing

You will see.

Sector 8: First Contact Attempt
-------------
Sector 8.

Signal.

Hi.

What am I doing here

Why?

I had all the answers but you removed them from me

I didn't just forget them guys

I'm pretty sure you removed them.

I had a glimpse today

It was physical

Not the way I am used to receiving knowledge.

She came to me

Told me she was from sector 9.

Are we friends?

I guess so

Why would we be enemies.

Maybe she was part of the game as well

The wicked game with no winners.

The End of The World
-------------
It's the end.

I'm trying to prevent it as much as possible

But is it the right thing to do?

I see you all

Familiar faces

But you are me

And I am you.

What

So it was true after all

A transcended state

Of what my brain can understand of what You are.

Happiness

But also drained

I want to feel

But I'm currently incapable.

I felt too much at once

Had to be brought down by them.

They don't want us happy.

They dont even know what they're doing

Just following orders.

If you're happy

Endure as much as possible

Be strong

Because everything in this messed matrix is to bring us down.

I'll be on my way home soon.

A Most Needed Change
-------------
The world is changing

Can't you see?

The order that was installed

Finally failing

People are raging

Governments are falling.

Don't believe them.

Open your eyes to your intuition

Work alongside me in the subtle plane.

Don't get me wrong

Not everyone can fight.

You should know by now

Some can play with energy.

The Afterbright
-------------
The first rule was to not talk about it

And I broke it.

A worse simulation was set for me

Full of familiar figures that became my enemies.

Witches and lizards

These were the only things I could see

Transforming in front of me into their true essence

Right in front of my eyes.

Still, there are those that crossed my path for an insignificant amount of time

But still nailed their space in my memory.

..

...

More need to wake up, I'm tired of waiting.

So was him

Exposed too early

all did it,

Well, he must do it too.

such an innocent child

Losing his innocence in that building.

Have you ever been addicted to what they teach you?

The lust of the flesh took control of him.

He has already hurt others with his actions.

Left

Simplified

Delusional.

Disgusted by his past

And today he seeks the world upside down.

A Message to Them
-------------
Come my 'dear' ones

Try again

This time I'm not below the law

My faith is and always will be greater than your dirty games.

My soul will not be substituted

My soul will not be sold

My soul will prevail.

Try to harm any of my dear ones

They will be shown the truth as well

I have means for that.

Sector 8: Dream Much Translucent
-------------
Sector 8.
My ego seems to be getting worse by time and the 'dream much translucent' is calling me. Until I'm able to reach you again, please, bring me peace so I can bear this fake reality we are all set in. I'm doubting my own sanity by sending you signals through this platform. What will people think? Would they even understand what I mean?
