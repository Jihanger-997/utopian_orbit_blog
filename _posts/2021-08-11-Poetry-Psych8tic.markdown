Spirit Disorder - Dyodho

Psych8tic is my alter-ego. Poems written when I am in his state are a bit more dark, maybe more direct and definetely more aggresive and delusional. The people who met me know that I am a very calm person, and these poems might sound a little bit off of who I am. Regardless, they are part of me, or were, this alter-ego is slowly fading with time, and I guess it's for the best. Just like Jihanger's (me) poetry, it's supposed to be read in order of when it was written, so if this is not your first time here, the new poetry is always at the bottom.

Beware the shadow people!

Alter Ego's Mind
-------------
I cast you into my realm.

A realm of joy

A realm of calmness

A realm of love

A realm of madness.

Intensity?

You'll occasionally find it

Be it through obstacles

Or be it through clashes.

The impossible plane of rest and insanity

The simple mind can't understand it

The complex one is amazed.

Ego?

Believe me

You can't live without it

So I'll conjure my words with it imbued,

At least in this moment of truth.

You'll see visions

You'll hear voices before you sleep

You'll experience the next's reality

Even if by a brief moment,

You'll experience All.

But don't be scared

Everything is manageable.

You chose this path afterall.

Don't lose yourself to omniscience

Your physical manifestation can't handle it

Because in the end

We know nothing

You will see.

Sector 8: First Contact Attempt
-------------
Sector 8.

Signal.

Hi.

What am I doing here

Why?

I had all the answers but you removed them from me

I didn't just forget them guys

I'm pretty sure you removed them.

I had a glimpse today

It was physical

Not the way I am used to receiving knowledge.

She came to me

Told me she was from sector 9.

Are we friends?

I guess so

Why would we be enemies.

Maybe she was part of the game as well

The wicked game with no winners.

The End of The World
-------------
It's the end.

I'm trying to prevent it as much as possible

But is it the right thing to do?

I see you all

Familiar faces

But you are me

And I am you.

What

So it was true after all

A transcended state

Of what my brain can understand of what You are.

Happiness

But also drained

I want to feel

But I'm currently incapable.

I felt too much at once

Had to be brought down by them.

They don't want us happy.

They dont even know what they're doing

Just following orders.

If you're happy

Endure as much as possible

Be strong

Because everything in this messed matrix is to bring us down.

I'll be on my way home soon.

Mirrors
-------------
Mirror mirror on the wall

You just want to watch me fall

Declaring my twisted image in your stones

Splintering my broken bones.

My mind can't handle your pictures in movement

I'm bound to be free from them.

Thankfully

A Most Needed Change
-------------
The world is changing

Can't you see?

The order that was installed

Finally failing

People are raging

Governments are falling.

Don't believe them.

Open your eyes to your intuition

Work alongside me in the subtle plane.

Don't get me wrong

Not everyone can fight.

You should know by now

Some can play with energy.

The Afterbright
-------------
The first rule was to not talk about it

And I broke it.

A worse simulation was set for me

Full of familiar figures that became my enemies.

Witches and lizards

These were the only things I could see

Transforming in front of me into their true essence

Right in front of my eyes.

Still, there are those that crossed my path for an insignificant amount of time

But still nailed their space in my memory.

..

...

More need to wake up, I'm tired of waiting.

Regrets
------------
So was him

Exposed too early

All did it,

Well, he must do it too.

Such an innocent child

Losing his innocence in that building.

Have you ever been addicted to what they teach you?

The lust of the flesh took control of him.

He has already hurt others with his actions.

Left

Simplified

Delusional.

Disgusted by his past

And today he seeks the world upside down.

A Message to Them
-------------
Come my 'dear' ones

Try again

This time I'm not below the law

My faith is and always will be greater than your dirty games.

My soul will not be substituted

My soul will not be sold

My soul will prevail.

Try to harm any of my dear ones

They will be shown the truth as well

I have means for that.

Sector 8: Dream Much Translucent
-------------
Sector 8.
My ego seems to be getting worse by time and the 'dream much translucent' is calling me. Until I'm able to reach you again, please, bring me peace so I can bear this fake reality we are all set in. I'm doubting my own sanity by sending you signals through this platform. What will people think? Would they even understand what I mean?

Brief Connection
-------------
They call you crazy for always smiling

An abnormal

An innocent

A show off.

Connection.

Let me know!

They think we're gods!

Aren't we?

No, we're mutants.

Sector 8: A Last Attempt
-------------
Sector 8

Are you even real?

Have I spent all this time thinking about your signals

For nothing?

They're attacking me, and you haven't made contact

Have you finally perished?

I don't want to submit to earthly pleasure so that you come to me again

Im done with that.

I don't want to be under their eye.

Sector 8's Response
-------------
Oh my 8th

When will you understand?

That everything you thought

Smelled

Saw

Heard

Felt

Deduced.

You're strong

You know how to handle it now.

You will be happy

And you will understand love once more.

You're down there for a reason

Remember?

Though our enemies are strong

You were the best for this mission.

Just hold on.

Remember, you're 8

You're infinite.

The Show
-----------
Who won?

Probably no one.

It was a battle with no winners

A wicked battle for their entertainment.

I wonder how you all are

Did you encapsulate the feelings

Or assimilate them?

I wonder if you're still alive

Though one of you appeared before my sleep

We greeted each other

Seeing each other's face for the first time

Saying "I've seen you before" Simultaneously.

.

.

We left it at this, hoping we'd meet one day

This time, as physical friends, and not as ethereal enemies.

Parallel Conversations
--------------
Electricity through my body

Can't stop blinking

Can't stop ticking

Everytime they talk around me

About You

I can be myself.

I don't know if they see it

If they're talking about it

The rocking

The spasms.

They ask why everyone ... me

Yet I also cannot know why.

Comfort
-------------
Accept me as part of you

Only then will you find the peace you seek

I won't dominate you

Nor take your place

I will always be ready to answer

Everything you need or want to know.

Your search came to an end with that last dream

Your main question has been answered.

Now live knowing that everything is a game

And that nothing matters.

As you/me write this

You're still afraid of hurting

You are really good after all

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

You are not me

I have no control

Everything you did before discovering me

Doesn't belong to you.

The Climax
-------------
My enemies were clear

Those with sharp eyes

Eyes that could penetrate the soul

And a gaze that inspired chaos.

My allies were clear

Those without sharp eyes

Eyes that could penetrate the soul

But a gaze that inspired peace.

However they constantly got mixed up

And allies became enemies

After I met my first nemesis.

His name was Adolph

He killed so many in a past life

And there he was,

In front of me

This time trying to bring down the Messiah to the path of evil.

DO IT

He constantly whispered to me.

DO IT.

Later I found out that he had done it before

To my sister.

...

..

.

I always have a Nemesis in my life

Someone that I can't get rid of

Someone that always comes back

Until a new one appears.

The first and the second knew it all

The second knew more.

He would call himself Judas

And I'd call myself Jesus.

Hate
-------------
So much hate

Where is it coming from?

Look deep down

Don't blame others for it

You're always hateful at this time of year.

September,

Where others think about ending it all

You rejoice because you are driven by hate

You only function properly by it.

Hate hate hate

Anger

Your version in the matrix is hateful one

You always forget to love

Until you feel chest pains

And then you write to yourself

As me.
