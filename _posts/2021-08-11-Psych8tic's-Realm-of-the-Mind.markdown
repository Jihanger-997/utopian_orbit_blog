I cast you into my realm.

A realm of joy

A realm of calmness

A realm of love

A realm of madness.

Intensity?

You'll occasionally find it

Be it through obstacles

Or be it through clashes.

The impossible plane of rest and insanity

The simple mind can't understand it

The complex one is amazed.

Ego?

Believe me

You can't live without it

So I'll conjure my words with it imbued

At least at this moment of truth.

You'll see visions

You'll hear voices before you sleep

You'll experience the next's reality

Even if by a brief moment,

You'll experience All.

But don't be scared

Everything is manageable.

You chose this path afterall.

Don't lose yourself to omniscience

Your physical manifestation can't handle it

Because in the end

We know nothing

You will see.
