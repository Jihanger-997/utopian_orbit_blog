Marilyn Moon

Hi Iâ€™m Marilyn Moon and let me tell you something: when the inspiration comes, I write passionately. Every word and every phrase comes perfect into place, to give meaning to my hearts voice. I have so much to say and a desire to be heard. Could you take a time to listen to me?

Comfort Food
-------------
In my family when I was a teenager we were very poor, choosing what to eat was a privilege that we hardly ever had.

We lived on my grandmother's land, which was shared with two other houses besides ours, my aunt's with my grandmother, her young son and her newest husband and the other house of my bachelor uncle.

My aunt had a financial condition slightly better than us, she always bought meat, pizzas, desserts and beverages for her son and offered it to us a few times. My grandma sometimes "stole" crackers and instant noodles and gave them to us. Her noodles was the best, she used to break the noodles, tradition that I still keep even after her death.

I spent most of my teenage years eating eggs and sausages. I hated sausages, because it was just what I ate for the most part of my life but still gives me comfort, just like the noodles but now without cruelty because as times changes, traditions change too.

Jihanger here. Mary, how she is usally referred to, is a childhood friend of mine. We were neighbors as kids, and would see each other almost everyday to play or talk. We stopped talking for a while because internet culture wasn't much difused, but if I'm not mistaken, when facebook was a thing, we reconnected. We talk sometimes everyday now, sometimes every week. She's a very special person, not only to me but as herself. Lots of love to give to the world, and we are always helping each other out. I chose her as a writer for the blog not only because she writes greatly, but also because she is open about her own emotions. I love her deeply and I believe our friendship will last a lifetime.
