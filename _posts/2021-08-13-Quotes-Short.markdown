Why are these thoughts still here?

It's been so long since you happened

I'm not even the same anymore

Completely transformed

And you are to praise.

That vacation.

<hr>

Bathe my feet with your waves

Clean my body from toe to lotus

I'll remember you fondly

Oh eternal weekend by the sand.

<hr>

Love no matter what

It will show you the way.

.

Seek your home.

.

.

.

Mine was 8.

Flip it.

<hr>


I planted love, reaped peace.


<hr>


Beware of jealousy

For it is a light-sleeper

Don't make too much turmoil next to it

Or you'll see it creeping out.

<hr>


Numbed to neutrality.


<hr>


All puppets from the same masters.


<hr>
