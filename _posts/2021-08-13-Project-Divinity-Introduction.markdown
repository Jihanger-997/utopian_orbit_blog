Project Divinity, that's what it is called for now, is an RPG game I'm developing with the help of friends. It's going to be divided into two parts, the first is being made on RPG Maker VX Ace, and the second will be made on RPG Maker MV. I've wanted to create a game on RPG Maker since my early teens, and as a teen I never had the artistic inspiration to finish any project. My first game was a big bash of games I've played throughout my childhood (Tibia, Grand Chase, Naruto, Dragonball, and many more), but I never managed to get past the first 5 minutes of gameplay development.

<h1>The Story</h1>
<hr>

The story takes place in the medieval and fantasy plane of Artimeshia, where humans lived in peace with the ancient races, until the Order of the Paladins came to existence and wiped them off so they could acquire the Silverite they guarded so dearly. The humans that were never interested in the Silverite, waged war on the Order, and now Artimeshia is divided into East and West. The East, the former allies of the ancient races, consist of the Northern people (fishermen and hunters of the icy north), and the Yafarians (desert nomad people, also the monks of the Floating Temple).

There are Spellblades in Artimeshia, who were the former caretakers of the world. They are born randomly throughout Artimeshia, and when one is discovered in the West, they are killed. If one is discovered in the East, they are sent to the Floating Temple for both protection and training. The Order declared war against the Spellblades, for they can ruin their plans of world domination. Through deceit and trickery, they make people believe Spellblades are abominations that need to be rid of.

Spellblades are the only ones able to control Nature Magic, at least with ease, and Elves were also able to control it. Dwarves could create relics with Silverite that could channel this magic, but all that were known were destroyed. Humans on the other hand, those that are not born Spellblades, with enough training can control it, but not to the same extent as the Elves and Spellblades.

The story begins with the main character, Sten, along with his friend/brother Marcus, meeting a weird human that calls herself an Android. She claims she is from the future, however, she doesn't remember why she was sent back to the past.

<h1>The Characters</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Sten</h4>
Sten is a rather complicated young adult that still acts like a child. On the good side, he doesn't let anything to himself - he says what's on his mind to anyone at any time. He's an orphan, just like Marcus, and his parents sent him to the Floating Temple when he still couldn't develop memories. They knew the Order would come after him, for he is the Divine Child of the Eastern prophecy. He abandoned the Temple before he finished his training, but is a powerful Spellblade nonetheless.

<h4>Marcus</h4>
A laid back man that couldn't leave his nomad origin behind. He's always traveling and met many interesting people through his travels. He's a childhood friend of Sten - they grew up together at the Floating Temple. He acts as an older brother to Sten, but that never goes the way he wished it did. He's a powerful Spellblade that after an incident, promised to never use offensive magic ever again.

<h4>Detail</h4>
An Android from the future. She has no memories of her former life, but knows one thing: she has to follow the first person she encounters. She's friendly and appears to have no emotions to others, but deep down suffers with her memories and flashbacks.

<h4>Giacherion and Theodorus</h4>
Find out yourself!


<h1>State of the Game</h1>
<hr>
So far, the main story progression of chapter 1 and 2 are fully programmed, missing only sidequests that the player can choose to do. The combat system will be balanced once the whole game is programmed, but you can get a feel of it (classic turn based front view). The story is completed, and is being modified on the go, so it can fit better as I program it.

You can play the alpha version, but as stated above, the combat is not yet balanced. I let all character be max level so you can experience just the story.
