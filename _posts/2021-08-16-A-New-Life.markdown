One

Two

Three were there

The beggining of ruin

The beggining of growth

The future restart.

Tripping.

Right after that you came

We've known each other for ages

But right after rediscovering ourselves

We lost each other.

What will it be now

Now that we know that what we know

Is everything we need to know at the given time.

Reset.

Not even if I tried explaining

You would understand

Not even if you know you understand

I know,

And do not understand.
