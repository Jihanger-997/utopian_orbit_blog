There I was

Seeing you next to me in bed

But I was a child just discovering myself all over again.

Blackness.

My good old friend

We finally meet here

But your face is shifting

Is there something wrong with me?

I calm down

You stop shifting

I'm finally in control.

We talk like the old days

You are angry for I have not been able to visit you

It's been a long time.

Blackness.

There I was

Strapped to a chair

Offered candies.

He laughs.

Melting.

There I was

Another room

Another reality.

I leave

For I was not welcome.

I see you

But I also see me

A momentary craziness due to similar candies

You tell me to talk to him

But I see nothing.
