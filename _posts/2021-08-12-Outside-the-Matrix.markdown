Outside the Matrix is a series of poems where I try to transcribe a rare type of dream I have: being on the other side. They are lucid and feel more real than anything I've experienced, usually ending after a message is passed onto me or with an waking sleep paralysis. They started around 2019, and only happened four times so far, with the exception of sleep paralyses where I was visited by beings of light, but I didn't write these down. Whenever I have a dream like this, I immediately write about it, in poem form, and I don't change what is written (with the exception of adding ponctuation).

They might seem a bit confusing, but I'm not trying to explain the dream, instead, I'm writing down the emotions I felt during that state.

Enjoy!



Meeting Friends and Snakes
-------------
There I was

Seeing you next to me in bed

But I was a child just discovering myself all over again.

Blackness.

My good old friend

We finally meet here

But your face is shifting

Is there something wrong with me?

I calm down

You stop shifting

I'm finally in control.

We talk like the old days

You are angry for I have not been able to visit you

It's been a long time.

Blackness.

There I was

Strapped to a chair

Offered candies.

He laughs.

Melting.

There I was

Another room

Another reality.

I leave

For I was not welcome.

I see you

But I also see me

A momentary craziness due to similar candies

You tell me to talk to him

But I see nothing.

Finally Answers?
-------------
I was listening to this guy talk

He was wailing.

I asked

Who are you.

He kept on talking.

Who are you

Wailing.

I listened to him.

He was protesting.

My dad and I were good there,

We looked exactly like each other.

I mean, how we look here,

We're the same anyway, doesn't matter.

I was being myself with my goofy sense of humor and he just called me to deploy something to someone.

I don't like to make deliveries.

I did anyway, felt a weight on my whole existence.

I was at the brisk of going out.

There was someone else there,

A family member.

It was him to my left my dad to my right.

I tried disconnecting but I couldnt.

Then the person to my left patted me on my back;

Oh now I remember

The guy who was wailing didn't want to be a lawyer anymore, but it doesn't make sense.

He was in a lawyer like room,

And I knew who to expect but he wasn't that person.

Anyway. Back to the pat on the back,

He showed me love and told me good night,

But I wanted to wake up not sleep.

Everything then turned black,

And I saw a screen in front of me.

I asked.

Yes.

I asked.

We. We are living this life we are meant to be where we are right now.

Unconditional love.

So much love.

I don't even know how to process this.

My face is still paralyzed with a dumbed out expression.

Ah yes, a family member was trying to trip me with his feet,

I got pissed and yelled at him,

But I didn't hate him.

Seems like it's part of it,

We, not I.

Attempts of Deceit
-------------
At the institution of madmen

I saw you

You asked me if I wanted to see him

I knew what he was.

Eagerness and blackness.

A mansion with a pool

Medusa.

Someone wanted my intimacy

Rejection and blackness.

The bathroom

But with another girl

Fear and blackness.

I'm back to the institution

Though now everything is dark.

I see you

With glowing white eyes and an open mouth

I meet him.

Paralysis and blackness.

If you want to get out of here

Stop with your mission.

.

.

.

I'm glad I didn't listen to him

Life has become beautiful

You can't hurt me if I don't feed you.
