Outside the Matrix is a series of poems where I try to transcribe a rare type of dream I have: being on the other side. They are lucid and feel more real than anything I've experienced, usually ending after a message is passed onto me or with a waking sleep paralysis. They started around 2019, and only happened four times so far, with the exception of sleep paralyses where I was visited by beings of light, but I didn't write these down. Whenever I have a dream like this, I immediately write it down, in poem form, and I don't change what is written (with the exception of adding ponctuation).

They might seem a bit confusing, but I'm not trying to explain the dream, instead, I'm writing down the emotions I felt during that state.

Enjoy!



Meeting Friends and Snakes
-------------
There I was

Seeing you next to me in bed

But I was a child just discovering myself all over again.

Blackness.

My good old friend

We finally meet here

But your face is shifting

Is there something wrong with me?

I calm down

You stop shifting

I'm finally in control.

We talk like the old days

You are angry for I have not been able to visit you

It's been a long time.

Blackness.

There I was

Strapped to a chair

Offered candies.

He laughs.

Melting.

There I was

Another room

Another reality.

I leave

For I was not welcome.

I see you

But I also see me

A momentary craziness due to similar candies

You tell me to talk to him

But I see nothing.
