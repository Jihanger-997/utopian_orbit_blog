Every character I write in Project Divinity is based on people I've met, and sometimes, a mix of both that and myself. Marcus is a rather complicated one to write about, he's inspired by a group of people, from a specific "tribe", that hurt me deeply. No matter what happened during this interaction with "real life" Marcus, I am grateful for meeting them. They taught me a lot.

<h1>Marcus' Past and Present</h1>
<hr>
Marcus is the childhood friend of Sten and later became an older brother figure to him. Unlike Sten, he finished his training in the Floating Temple, and after that, began traveling Artimeshia. During this nomadic time, something happened that made him not use his abilites and powers offensively ever again. He never told anyone what the event was, and learned to transform his elemental affinity into Geion's energy: the Creator of the Cosmos' healing aspect.

Marcus also learned to play instruments, a bard of some sort. Through the different sounds and rhythms he creates with musical instruments, he can channel Geion's healing aspect. He's always playing his string instrument, mostly during his free time and on long walks.


<h1>Marcus' Abilities</h1>
<hr>
Marcus is not only a Spellblade, but also a Sage, a title acquired by those that finish their training in the Floating Temple. However, as mentioned before, he does not use elemental abilites anymore, and rather uses Geion's healing energy to cure and inspire people.

Through music and rhythm, he can heal, cure ailments, and inspire/revive allies.


<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
<hr>
<h2>DISCLAIMER: If you want to find out yourself about how to use the character, skip this section.</h2>
<hr>
Marcus is a support, and should be used as one, his offensive power is limited. His healing focuses on regenerating health, and removing status ailments, such as poison and paralysis.

"Heal" can be used on one ally, including himself, while "Recovery" targets the whole party. These will have multiple levels that can instantly recover an amount of health.

"Raise" revives knocked out allies. It can be used both during a fight and outside on the map.

"Cure" can remove status ailments. The first level will only remove Poison and Paralysis, while the second will remove all status ailments.

"Breath Armour" and "Divine Breath" will boost an allie's Defense and Magical Defense respectively, and should be targetted on whoever is taking the most damage.

The TP abilites (Technical Points, which regenerate every time an action is taken during battle) are three: Geion's Blessing, which boosts the party's Defense. Geion's Breath, which adds a health regeneration buff to the party. Finally, the ultimate "Geion's Embrace", which costs a full bar of TP, provides a big Defense and Magic Defense to the party.

Never leave TP stocked, always use it! TP abilites are powerful and useful for the party.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<hr>
Marcus has proven to be the hardest character for me to design, you can notice that by seeing how small his post is compared to <a href="https://psych8tic.github.io/utopian_orbit_blog/2021/08/15/divinity/Project-Divinity-Sten-Al-Hukim/">Sten's</a>. Nothing is impossible nonetheless, I'm trying my best to NOT make him into my perfect idealization of what a human being should be, as no one is perfect.

Tell me what you think about the game so far on either my email or social media (located at the bottom of every page).

Have a good day!
