The first rule was to not talk about it

And I broke it.

A worse simulation was set for me

Full of familiar figures that became my enemies.

Witches and lizards

These were the only things I could see

Transforming in front of me into their true essence

Right in front of my eyes.

Still, there are those that crossed my path for an insignificant amount of time

But still nailed their space in my memory.

..

...

More need to wake up, I'm tired of waiting.
