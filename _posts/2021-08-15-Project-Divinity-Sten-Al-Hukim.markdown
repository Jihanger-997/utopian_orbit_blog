Every character I write in Project Divinity is based on people I've met, and sometimes, a mix of both that and myself. Sten is no exception. He's a bash of what I used to wish my life could've been, and is heavily inspired on what would have been of me if I didn't have my delusional phase. He's the character you follow during your time in Artimeshia, with the exception of the chapter where you will follow Detail's brief lonely adventure (I will talk about Detail in another post).

<h1>Sten's Path</h1>
<hr>
Sten will have the chance to prove to others, and specifically Detail, that he's a person who wants to evolve to be a better person. Much of this will be influenced by the fact that he is the Divine Child of the Eastern Prophecy, which he neglects everytime somebody mentions it. Yes, everyone is aware of the fact he is this Child, including Sten. He hates that he is treated in a special manner by everyone that knows this, but doesn't do them wrong (most of the time).

During chapter 1 through 3, Sten has empath moments towards Detail, but those are little. Most of the time he treats her as less than a human, and she feels it deep down but doesn't show it. This passive atitude of Detail, along with the fact that Sten lacks some self control of what he says, could make their relation go a dark path.

His relationship with Marcus has always been the same. Sten is lousy while Marcus is the complete opposite: someone who measures his words carefully (there will be a post about Marcus in the future as well). Sten's uncontrolled emotions are sometimes used against him by Marcus so that he does what he wants, but Sten is so engulfed by his own emotions that hes doesn't notice that. Will this also make their relation go to the abysm?

<h1>Sten's Abilites</h1>
<hr>
Sten is naturally a skilled fighter. This added up to the fact that he is a Spellblade makes him a force to be reckoned with. The Paladins of the Order are aware he is the Divine Child, but know that he has still not awakened his powers to the full extent. They know the people around him are trying to make him transcend, and recently have begun making moves to avoid that.

He can control Wind, Fire, and Lightning, in addition to Ice to some extent. He can imbue his weapon with elemental power, making his attacks more powerful and acquiring special offensive(maybe one will have a defensive) attributes that have a chance to trigger. Depending on the level of the enchantment he uses, it has a higher chance to trigger. He can also cast single and multi-targetted elemental spells, and use offensive/defensive support spells, that are either cast directly on enemies, allies , or on his weapon.

<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
<hr>
<h2>DISCLAIMER: If you want to find out yourself about how to use the character, skip this section.</h2>
<hr>
Sten is the only playable character able to enchant his weapon, and this should always be used. The special effects they can cause on the enemy and allies are powerful and useful.

Ignis, can cause a percentage of the enemy's life to be lost every turn, and should be used on enemies with high amounts of Health Points.

Glacie is still being developed, and will either have a chance to freeze the enemy or trigger an ice shield on Sten.

Ictus, which is Thunder (or Lightning), will trigger "Hyped Up!". This will make Sten have a chance of having an extra attack action (or maybe even an extra turn), that can be cumulative. It will depend on your luck if you will have only one extra action, or (statistically impossible) infinite times! This should be used when you have 2 or more enchantments active, so you can add up the debuffs/buffs on your targets.

Elemental spells (Fire, Wind, and Bolt) should be used according to the elemental weakness of the enemies.

The special TP abilities (Technique Points, which are regenerated when an action is taken during battle), are still being developed and will have many uses. There's even two TP Weapon Enchantments, that could be considered Ultimates!

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<hr>
Sten is a powerful Battle Mage that needs to learn how to treat people better. He doesn't measure his words but is a good person nonetheless. His awakening is something expected and will be shown during the first part of the game, which will consist of four chapters.
