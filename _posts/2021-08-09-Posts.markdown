General posts I write will be posted here.


14/09/2021 - Present and Expected Future
-------------
Hey peeps. Today I'm sharing with you what my current situation is and what I expect to come in the next 10 years. It's the first time I write or even think about this, so bear with the confusion.

I'm currently living in the middle east, managing to get basic needs as everyone here in this country is trying to. I lived my whole life in big cities, and the past two years or so I've been living in the countryside. If I remember correctly, this is where I wanted to be when I was a teenager. I think the rush and lies of the big city are getting through me, they don't appeal to me anymore.

My family and I are trying to escape the country, and we will soon be off to another place. We can't go back to a country where everything is falling a part, in case you're wondering why we don't go back to my homeland. Anyway, I hope I can continue my university here as long as it is online, since I'm almost done with it (computer science second to third year), and I don't want to transfer and lose credits when I register.

I hope I can open a business while I'm outside, and make  a living off of it, while I make games as a side project and maybe touch some people's minds and hearts with them. If the business doesn't work, I will find a developer job to fill in the time. We believe our country will be back at its feet in the future, and we will come back once it does. It's a beautiful country indeed.

Psych8tic is telling me to go and travel the world, but how am I gonna do that if I don't have the money, right? Maybe I'll be able to do it someday.

My dreams are on pause at the moment and we are just trying to get our basic needs, which have become hard to come by in this country. The first goal I have on my "life book" is to become a well known game developer/designer, something I feel deep down will happen in some sort of way that I will not expect. If I'm not mistaken the second one is to be free from nicotine, last time I tried quitting I managed to stay more than twelve hours, a pretty good accomplishment.

My depression alter ego just said "I just wanna die". That guy can go fuck himself (just kidding, he needs care, I know).

It's funny how I treat my temporary depression state with despise while other people's I'd do everything to make them feel better, I need to be less harsh on myself.
